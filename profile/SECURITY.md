# Security Policy for IMAV Learning Academy Pvt Ltd

## Our Commitment

IMAV Learning Academy is committed to ensuring the security of our systems, platform, and user data. We value the contributions of security researchers and the community in helping us maintain a safe environment.

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any of IMAV Learning Academy's systems, websites, or repositories hosted under our GitHub organization, please report it to us privately.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **[info@imav.world]**

## What to Include

Please include the following details in your report:
* A clear description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it.
* The specific URL, repository, application, or system affected.
* Any relevant technical details, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code.
* Your contact information (optional, but helpful for follow-up).

## Our Process

* We will aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 5-7 business days.
* We will investigate the report and determine its validity and severity.
* We will work to remediate the vulnerability in a timely manner.
* We request that you maintain confidentiality and do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it. We will coordinate with you on public disclosure if appropriate.

## Scope

This policy applies to security vulnerabilities found in IMAV Learning Academy's primary website, learning platform, and any repositories hosted under our official GitHub organization. Please note that third-party services or platforms we utilize may have their own security reporting processes.

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research and vulnerability reporting conducted under this policy to be authorized and will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith and adhere to this policy. However, we do not authorize actions that could harm our systems or data, such as denial-of-service attacks or unauthorized access to user data.

Thank you for helping keep IMAV Learning Academy and our users safe.
