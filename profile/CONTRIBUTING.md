# Contributing to IMAV Learning Academy Pvt Ltd

Thank you for your interest in contributing to IMAV Learning Academy's projects!

## Our GitHub Presence

Our GitHub organization primarily serves the following purposes:
* Hosting code examples, exercises, and supplementary materials for our students.
* Internal development of our platform and tools.
* Potentially sharing open-source educational resources or tools in the future.

## How to Contribute

At this time, most of our repositories contain proprietary course materials or are used for internal development. Therefore, we generally do not accept direct code contributions via pull requests from the public on most repositories.

However, we welcome feedback and suggestions!

### Reporting Issues or Suggesting Improvements
* **For Students:** If you are an enrolled student and find an issue with course materials, code examples, or have suggestions, please use the established support channels (like our 24/7 Discord server) or contact your instructor directly.
* **For Public Repositories:** If you find a bug, typo, or have a suggestion for one of our specifically designated public or open-source repositories (if any), please feel free to open an issue in that specific repository. Please check the repository's own `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` for any specific guidelines.

### Code Contributions (Limited)
If we have specific open-source projects accepting contributions, they will have detailed contribution guidelines within their own repository. Please follow those instructions. Unsolicited pull requests to other repositories may not be reviewed.

## Internal Contributors
If you are a member of the IMAV Learning Academy team, please refer to our internal development guidelines and workflows.

## Code of Conduct
All contributors and participants interacting with IMAV Learning Academy's GitHub presence are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please ensure you are familiar with it.

We appreciate your understanding and support in helping us maintain a high-quality learning environment!
